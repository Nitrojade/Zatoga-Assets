# Zatoga Assets

**All credits goes to [@3kh0](https://github.com/3kh0)! He has made the game collection and I just uploaded them to this repo for my website, ["Zatoga"](https://github.com/NitroJade/Zatoga)â™¥**

All games will be hosted here due to the amount of files. It overloads GitHub so hard, to GitHub, I am so sorry! For the main site, we using [githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/) as a CDN to load the games, so no more 15 minute deploy times and size limits.

**Skidding this gets you no gain, so {    } off.**

If you want to check out 3kh0's site, head to [https://zatoga.net](https://zatoga.net)

The main repo for the original 3kh0 website can be found at [https://github.com/Nitrojade/zatoga-games](https://github.com/Nitrojade/zatoga-games)


### Embedding

The base URL for the CDN is https://raw.githack.com/Nitrojade/Zatoga-Assets/main/index.html

SO pretty much just add the folder of the game you want, say 2048, the url would be
```
https://raw.githack.com/Nitrojade/Zatoga-Assets/main/2048/index.html
```
And you would replace `2048` with the title of the folder, this is the best method since the game would be up-to-date always, in case of something like a update or something breaks.

Make a standard iframe, and set the URL to the one you made above, you can always go to the link to see if it works or not
You can also use other cdns such as rawgit (you have to self host it), gitloaf, and gitcdn (you have to self host this too).

### Hard-adding
If you are gonna do this, you are gonna do it yourself. The amount of files made the deployment for the website from 30 seconds to 15 minutes and most of the time it would fail because it was too large, so just keep that in mind.
